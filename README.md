# Introduction

Welcome to Flutter Internals, a **community-maintained** open source book providing a guided tour through Flutter's implementation.

This book is very much a living document; in fact, we'd **love your help** with grammatical fixes, technical edits, and new content.

## What is this book?

* The goal of this book is to provide intuitive descriptions of Flutter’s internals in an easily digestible outline format.
* Descriptions are intended to be comprehensive without becoming bogged down in implementation details or sacrificing clarity.
* This book strives to provide a “hawk’s eye view” of Flutter’s implementation.

## Who is the audience of this book?

* Contributors seeking to ramp up on how the framework works, developers looking to build intuition about Flutter internals, anyone looking for a guided tour through the code.
* These notes may serve as a reference for other types of learning materials \(such as a deep dive video series\).

## Who can contribute to this book?

* Anyone \(thank you\)! If there’s a corner of the framework that you find confusing, please consider [becoming a contributor](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/flutter-internals?invite=-Lz8eupmUYQGm6UH34Dq) and updating the book with the relevant details.
