# Introduction

Welcome to Flutter Internals, a **community-maintained** open source book providing a guided tour through Flutter's implementation.

This book is very much a "work in progress"; in fact, we'd **love your help** with grammatical fixes, technical edits, and new content.

## What is this book?

* The goal of this book is to provide intuitive descriptions of Flutter’s internals in an easily digestible outline format.
* Descriptions are intended to be comprehensive without becoming bogged down in implementation details or sacrificing clarity.
* This book strives to provide a “hawk’s eye view” of Flutter’s implementation.

## Who is the audience of this book?

* These notes are most useful once you have a solid understanding of how to use Flutter \(since they describe how the interfaces actually work\).
* This outline was written for developers looking to build intuition about Flutter internals and Flutter hackers looking to ramp up on the codebase.
* We also hope that this book can inspire more thorough learning materials \(such as deep dive videos or long form articles\).

## Who can contribute to this book?

* Anyone \(thank you\)! If there’s a corner of the framework that you find confusing, please consider [becoming a contributor](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/flutter-internals?invite=-Lz8eupmUYQGm6UH34Dq) and updating the book with the relevant details.
* **Please read the "Get Involved" section.**
