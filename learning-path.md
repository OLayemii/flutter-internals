# Learning Path

This book is written in outline format and is fairly terse. In order to get the most out of this book, we recommend the following learning path:

* Read the [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour).
  * A basic understanding of Dart is, of course, essential.
* Skim the official [Flutter Development Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development).
  * The official docs provide a great starting point for using Flutter as a developer.
* Skim the official [Inside Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/inside-flutter) article.
  * This article will give you a general idea of what's happening behind the scenes.
* Read Didier Boelen's [Flutter Internals](https://www.didierboelens.com/2019/09/flutter-internals/) article.
  * Didier's article has outstanding illustrations and descriptions that will help you develop intuition about how Flutter works.
* Read through this book, referencing the [code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/flutter/lib) and [API docs](http://api.flutter.dev).
  * This book will help you integrate your conceptual understanding with how the framework actually works.

 Unfortunately, though methods and identifiers are frequently referenced, we haven't been able to provide deep linking to the relevant code just yet.

If you're able, clone a copy of the Flutter repository and use a tool like `grep` to find the relevant sections. A source code browser with identifier linking is even better.

Good luck!
