# Get Involved ‚ùó

This book is a community effort with the singular goal of shining a light on how Flutter actually works.

Given the breadth and scope of the framework, there's a lot of material to cover and a lot of material to review. Suffice to say: **we need your help!**

Any and all contributions are much appreciated. Keep on reading for ways to get involved.
